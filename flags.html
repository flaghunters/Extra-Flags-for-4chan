                <p>By default, the flags on posts are cut out from the flagsheet shown on the left. It can be found
                    here:

            The boxes between Iceland and Greenland are for flags present on the 4chan server, or were once on the
            server but got changed. These flags are displayed in boxes as they do not correspond to any territory as
            shown on the map, as they either are non-territorial entities or will cause overlaps if attempted to be
            displayed on the map.
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="grid">
            <div><span class="flags flags-a1a2"></span></div>
            <div style="margin-top: 0px;">
                A1 and A2 are anonymous proxy and satellite provider respectively, and show up as Andorran flags that
                are labelled 'Unknown' when hovered over. These direct to a.gif when clicked on.
            </div>

            <div><span class="flags flags-xx"></span></div>
            <div>
                XX is a blank white flag with a question mark on it. It occurs most often when a thread is moved from
                another board. It shows up as 'Unknown' when hovered over and directs to xx.gif when clicked on.
            </div>

            <div><span class="flags flags-apeu"></span></div>
            <div>
                AP and EU are the Asia-Pacific region and Europe respectively. AP shows up as an Andorran flag that is
                labelled 'Unknown' when hovered over, but directs to ap.gif when clicked on. EU shows up as the European
                flag.
            </div>

            <div><span class="flags flags-aqlymemmuzvaxk"></span></div>
            <div>
                AQ represents the old flag of Antarctica. LY is the flag of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, which is no
                longer in use. ME is an old version of the flag of Montenegro, it is 16x12 instead of 16x11. MM is the
                old flag of Myanmar. UZ is the old flag of Uzbekistan, the colour differs from the current one. VA is
                the old rectangular version of the flag of the Holy See. XK represents Kosovo before the flag got
                properly added to the flagsheet. All of them have been changed on the 4chan server.
            </div>

            <div><span class="flags flags-ancs"></span></div>
            <div>
                AN and CS are the Netherlands Antilles and Serbia and Montenegro respectively. Both are entities that no
                longer exist but remain flags on the 4chan server.
            </div>

            <div><span class="flags flags-gbes"></span></div>
            <div>
                GB and ES represent the four flags of England, Scotland, Wales, and Catalonia. These are included on the
                template as they are flags on the 4chan server.
            </div>

            <div><span class="flags flags-fam"></span></div>
            <div>
                FAM is the flag of the company that made the default flag icons; its flag is likewise on the server.
            </div>
        </div>

        <p> *It should be noted that unlike the three pseudo-Andorran flags shown above (A1, A2, and AP), actual posts
            from Andorra will be labelled 'Andorra' when hovered over and direct to ad.gif when clicked on.
        </p>

        <p> *The flags of England, Scotland, Wales, and Catalonia on the 4chan server are not identiccal to those used
            in Extra Flags.
        </p>

        <p> The flags labelled with blue or red text in the boxes above, as well as Bouvet Island (BV), Heard Island and
            the MacDonald Islands (HM), and Western Sahara (EH) are unobtainable legitimately. They do not have Internet
            service providers, but it is possible to post with these flags using a proxy. All three of them have already
            been posted with on 4chan.
